[float]
=== Description
`parseInt()` returns the first valid (long) integer number from the current position.

In particular:

* Parsing stops when no characters have been read for a configurable time-out value, or a non-digit is read; +
* If no valid digits were read when the time-out (see link:../streamsettimeout[Stream.setTimeout()]) occurs, 0 is returned;

This function is part of the Stream class, and can be called by any class that inherits from it (Wire, Serial, etc). See the link:../../stream[Stream class] main page for more information.

=== Syntax
`stream.parseInt()` +
`stream.parseInt(lookahead)` +
`stream.parseInt(lookahead, ignore)`


[float]
=== Parameters
`stream` : an instance of a class that inherits from Stream. +
`lookahead`: the mode used to look ahead in the stream for an integer. Allowed data types: `LookaheadMode`. Allowed `lookahead` values:

* `SKIP_ALL`: all characters other than digits or a minus sign are ignored when scanning the stream for an integer. This is the default mode.
* `SKIP_NONE`: Nothing is skipped, and the stream is not touched unless the first waiting character is valid.
* `SKIP_WHITESPACE`: Only tabs, spaces, line feeds, and carriage returns are skipped.

`ignore`: used to skip the indicated char in the search. Used for example to skip thousands divider. Allowed data types: `char`
